        <h3>JMVI REALTY MOBILE APPLICATION USER LICENSE AGREEMENT</h3>

        <h4>1. Our service</h4>
        <p>Our Mobile Application (the JMVI App) facilitates an exciting and convenient way to purchase, sell and lease Real Estate and where applicable, any other goods using the Internet and is wholly owned and operated by J.M. Ventures Inc. a limited liability Company registered under the Laws of Antigua & Barbuda (‘JMVI’). We also provide an online auction facility vehicle through which traders, Real Estate Vendors and Entities or individuals possessing the legal right to exercise a Power of Sale, can sell and Users can buy Real Estate and/or goods (where applicable) (‘the Services’).</p>
		<p>It is important that you read and understand these terms before using the Services. By accessing or using the Services or the Mobile Application running on IOS or Android Operating Systems, you accept the terms of this User Licence Agreement and agree to be legally bound by such terms, as they may be modified from time to time. We reserve the right to change these terms at any time. Amendments will take effect when posted on our Mobile Application. However, the terms current as at the start of a particular transaction will apply until that transaction is completed. If you do not accept these terms, do not use the Mobile Application.</p>

        <h4>2. Our role</h4>
        <p>Our Mobile Application is a place primarily for Real Estate owners and Vendors to auction, sell and/or Lease Real Estate and/or Goods and for Users to bid for, purchase and/or Lease Real Estate and/or Goods. We do not have and never intend to have any contractual involvement in your transactions and at no stage auction, buy or sell or purport to auction, buy or sell any of the Real Estate displayed on our Mobile Application. The Mobile Application acts as a forum through which, among other things Auctions and other Real Estate Transactions are conducted. The Contract at the conclusion of the Auction, Lease or private Sale is made between the User and the Seller and/or Lessor or his Agent. JMVI contracts separately with the Seller and the User and this User Licence Agreement govern those relationships.  Any disputes between buyers and sellers are just that: we will not become involved. You must therefore take the utmost care to screen the parties with whom you deal. We will not screen the parties on your behalf and this is a feature of the relationship between you and us that you willingly accept.</p>        
        <p>JMVI grants you a limited non-exclusive license to install, use, access, display and run one copy of the Mobile Application on a Mobile Device. You may not make the JMVI Mobile Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple mobile devices at the same time. You may make one copy of the Mobile Application in machine readable form for backup purposes only, provided that the backup copy must include all copyright or other proprietary notices contained on the original.</p>        

        <h4>3. Limitations on User Rights</h4>
        <p>You may not, nor enable others to copy, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or algorithms of, the Mobile Application (except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation), or modify, or disable any features of the Mobile Application, or create derivative works based on the Mobile Application.</p>        
        <p>JMVI reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this User License Agreement. The Mobile Application is protected by its trademarks, copyright and intellectual property laws and treaties. JMVI and/or its suppliers own the title, copyright and other intellectual property rights in the mobile application. The Mobile Application is licensed, not sold nor transferred by way of gift.</p>        

        <h4>4. Registration and qualification to use the Services</h4>
        <p>4.1  You are required to register with us by completing the registration form on our home page and submitting it to us. Only adults (that is, those aged 18 years and over) are entitled to enter into legally binding contracts and as a result only adults are entitled to use the Services. Any individuals who are unable to form legally binding contracts are prohibited from using the Services. <b>By registering you are making a statement, upon which we are entitled to rely, that you are aged 18 years or older and capable of forming a legally binding contract</b>.</p>        
        <p>4.2  On occasions certain individuals and members will be refused access to the Services. Such suspensions shall be within our sole discretion.</p>

        <h4>5. Information you provide</h4>
        <p>5.1 You grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free licence to use any information you provide to us or other users of our services, for example during the registration, listing, reservation or bidding process.</p>        
        <p>5.2 Such information shall be legal, decent, honest and truthful, shall not infringe any third party's rights, shall not contain any viruses or other malicious computer programming routines and shall not link to any other websites unless written consent is obtained from JMVI. Without limiting the above, all information you provide shall be accurate and complete and all registration details shall contain your correct name, address, credit or debit card number and other requested details.</p>

        <h4>6. Security</h4>
        <p>6.1 You are solely responsible in all respects for all use of and for protecting the confidentiality of any email verification number and password which may be given to or selected by you for use on our Mobile Application. You may not share these with or transfer them to any third parties. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorised use of them or any other breach of security regarding the Services.</p>        
        <p>6.2 We use third party services to secure and protect your credit card information and assist your user experience. However, any losses incurred or sustained by you in transmitting information shall be borne solely and exclusively by you and in no event shall any such losses in whole or in part be borne by us.</p>

        <h4>7. Availability of Mobile Application</h4>
        <p>While we will use all reasonable endeavours to make our Services and Mobile Application available, we cannot guarantee that they will operate continuously or without interruptions. This could affect bidding, reservation payments, or other aspects of an auction, sale or Lease.</p>        

        <h4>8. General rules governing bidding, buying and leasing</h4>
        <p>8.1 To use and rely on the Services we provide, all participants must understand their obligations to other users of our Services. If you are the highest bidder after an auction has closed and made payment of a Registration Deposit, the seller may accept your bid and thereafter complete the transaction.</p>
        <p>8.2 Sellers are entitled to set applicable minimum bid or reserve requirements and are entitled to change these during the auction period. You may not retract a bid except in exceptional circumstances, for example where the seller has materially changed the conditions of Sale by Auction.</p>
        <p>8.3 Your placing of a bid entitles us and any seller to rely on your bid and as a result you warrant and undertake that you have the legal right to make such a bid and to enter into any such transaction.</p>
        <p>8.4 If you bid for Real Estate on our Mobile Application, you acknowledge and agree that if you have placed the highest bid at or above any reserve price in the Auction and have paid a Registration Deposit, you have entered into a contract with the seller (where applicable, on the terms and conditions as contained in a draft of the contract as provided) to buy the Real Estate. You also provide assurances and agree to, within a reasonable time, take all such steps and to do all such things as are necessary to formalize and execute such contract. You can only terminate that contract in limited circumstances set out in law, for example where you cannot identify the seller. Sellers may refuse to accept your bid or treat with their offer as being accepted until such time 100% of the Purchaser’s Deposit has been paid to the Seller or his Agent or such other material terms of Contract have been substantially performed.</p>

        <h4>9. General rules governing listing and selling</h4>
        <p>9.1 In relation to all Real Estate you sell or offer for sale through the Services:
        <div style='margin-left:20px;'>
            <p>9.1.1 you must be the absolute legal owner with the right to sell the Real Estate;</p>
            <p>9.1.2 if the above does not apply, you must be the owner of a Legal Charge in respect of which the Real Estate is subject and comply with all provisions contained in any applicable Laws for the exercise of your Power of Sale; and</p>
            <p>9.1.3 your sale of the Real Estate must not infringe any third party rights or be illegal or unlawful in any way.</p>
        </div>
    </p>        
    <p>9.2 If selling or leasing real estate, you must provide accurate and appropriate descriptions and provide such information as we may request (together, <b>the Listing Information</b>). Once provided and approved after the payment of any applicable registration/listing fees, the Real Estate becomes 'Listed Real Estate'. Once a property becomes a Listed Real Estate, you are making an irrevocable offer to auction, sell or lease.</p>
    <p>9.3 Any seller receiving at least one bid at or above any stated applicable minimum or reserve requirement is obliged to complete the transaction with the highest bidder following closure of the auction unless the buyer fails to meet the terms of the listing or the seller is unable to authenticate the identity of the buyer.</p>
    <p>9.4 A Listed Real Estate will remain listed on the Mobile Application until:
    <div style='margin-left:20px;'>
        <p>9.4.1 it is sold or leased; or</p>
        <p>9.4.2 the seller-specified listed time expires; or</p>
        <p>9.4.3 we receive written notice via fax or email from you that you wish to de-list it.</p>
    </div>
</p>
<p>A Listed Real Estate will be de-listed on receipt by us of written notice via email from you that you wish to de-list it, but we will retain any applicable registration fee paid with respect to the Real Estate.</p>
<p>9.5  If you list Real Estate for sale at a reserve price, you have the option to consider bids received below that reserve price.</p>
<p>9.6  You must not contact any buyers directly in a sale of Listed Real Estate whether offered by you or another seller.</p>
<p>9.7 You must not directly or indirectly place bids on Listed Real Estate you offer for sale on our site or manipulate bidding in any other way as this may be considered fraudulent and you may then become liable for criminal prosecution.</p>

<h4>10. Payment</h4>
<p>10.1 Subject to any limited Promotional Fee Waiver by a JMVI Authorised Representative, all sellers pay a registration fee for each Listed Real Estate. We will invoice sellers monthly on all Listed Real Estate. All payments must be received by us within 15 days from the date of invoice and we shall be entitled to charge interest on any late payment at a rate of 15% per Annum calculated on a daily basis until payment is received.</p>
<p>10.2 All buyers must pay sellers for items using  Paypal, credit or debit cards, cheques, banker's drafts <b>or where applicable, Bitcoins or other general accepted digital currencies</b>. However the method of payment shall be left to the discretion of the seller in each case and communicated to the User at the time of the transaction. Payments shall be received in the currency specified on the Mobile Application and all prices are exclusive of any applicable taxes, filing fees and disbursements.</p>

<h4>11. Privacy policy and Location Data</h4>
<p>11.1 We take privacy issues seriously. Our current privacy policy covers our use of any information you provide. In using our Services you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the terms of our privacy policy which is available upon request and at a reasonable fee.</p>

<h4>12. Termination</h4>
<p>JMVI has in its sole discretion the right to issue a warning, temporary suspension, or an indefinite suspension and termination of your rights to use our Services if you:</p>
<p>12.1 act inconsistently and in breach of these terms and conditions;</p>
<p>12.2 at any time violate or attempt to violate any rights of any other user of the Services or third party;</p>
